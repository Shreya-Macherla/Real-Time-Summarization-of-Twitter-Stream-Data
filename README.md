# Real-Time-Summarization-of-Twitter-Stream-Data

•	Explored a combination of techniques from natural language processing and machine learning to generate a summary of the main topics and trends being discussed on social media streams like Twitter.

•	Created a Real-Time streaming pipeline using Flink, that listens to tweets based on Hashtags and saves them to MySQL. 

•	Event detection was done based on bursty periods of the tweets. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to generate important topics, their trends, and summaries.

•	Technologies: LDA, NLP, TensorFlow, SciPy, NumPy, Tweepy, Matplotlib, Python.
